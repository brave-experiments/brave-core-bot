# Progress Reporting

APPEND to ./brave-core-bot/progress.txt (never replace, always append).

**IMPORTANT:** Every progress entry MUST include a `Resume command` line with the claude resume command for the current session. Use the format: `claude -r <session-id>` where `<session-id>` is the current conversation's session ID. This allows easy resumption of the agent.
